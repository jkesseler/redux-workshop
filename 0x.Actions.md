# Actions
Actions are payloads of information that send data from your application to your store. They are the only source of information for the store. Actions are defined as plain JS objects.

```js
const action = {
  type: 'ADD_TODO',
  payload: {
    text: 'Write an article on Redux actions'
  }
}
```

Actions must have a `type` property that indicates the type of action being performed. Types should typically be defined as string constants. Once your app is large enough, you may want to move them into a separate module.

The only required key of an action object is `type`, the rest is up to the developer. In order to keep
things consistent [https://github.com/redux-utilities/flux-standard-action](Flux Standard Actions) are recommended. It defines a standard how actions should look.

Basic FSA.
```js
{
    type: 'SOME_TYPE',
    payload: {
      /* whatever data you need */
    },
}
```

FSA representing an error. For instance a rejected promise or server error.
```js
{
  type: 'FETCH_ERROR',
  payload: new Error(),
  error: true
}
```

## Actions

An action MUST

* be a plain JavaScript object.
* have a `type` property.

An action MAY

* have an `error` property.
* have a `payload` property.
* have a `meta` property.

An action MUST NOT include properties other than `type`, `payload`, `error`, and `meta`.

### `type`

The `type` of an action identifies to the consumer the nature of the action that has occurred. `type` is a string constant. If two types are the same, they MUST be strictly equivalent (using `===`).

### `payload`

The optional `payload` property MAY be any type of value. It represents the payload of the action. Any information about the action that is not the `type` or status of the action should be part of the `payload` field.

By convention, if `error` is `true`, the `payload` SHOULD be an error object. This is akin to rejecting a promise with an error object.

### `error`

The optional `error` property MAY be set to `true` if the action represents an error.

An action whose `error` is true is analogous to a rejected Promise. By convention, the `payload` SHOULD be an error object.

If `error` has any other value besides `true`, including `undefined` and `null`, the action MUST NOT be interpreted as an error.

### `meta`

The optional `meta` property MAY be any type of value. It is intended for any extra information that is not part of the payload.
